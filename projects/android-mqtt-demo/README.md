Android MQTT Client - Demo

This is a simple client to demonstrate the use of fusesource/mqtt-client library on Android.

Once you have cloned the repo, you can build the project in eclipse with Android SDK.

To Build the project in eclipse:

1) Select: File -> New -> Android Project

2) Give the project a name

3) Select: Create project from existing source

4) Browse to the location where you cloned the repo

5) Click Finish

Once the project is created you will need to add the mqtt-client lib dependency.

This can be done by cloning the fusesource/mqtt-client repo and building the project.
Then add the mqtt-client uber jar to the build path.
